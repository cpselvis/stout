 * Why I want to create this wheel? I get inspiration from peg.js which is a generator for parser.
 * But it seems complex to use because it's grammar isn't easy to understand, so I try to write a
 * parser use pure javascript code.
 *
 * And I named it stouts, it's just a kind of beer. I love it's strong flavour and dark color.
